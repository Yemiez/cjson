# CJSON - JSON Parser in C
A simple JSON parser made in C, compiled and tested on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04, GCC 10.2.0) and Windows (GCC 10.2.0).

This is a sample project, used as an education tool to become more proficient in C

## TODO
* Documentation and examples
* Utility functions (such as convenient lookup functions, i.e. `key>depth1>depth2>depth3>[4]`);.
* Optimise memory usage (currently the internal `cjson_state*` hogs up a lot of memory during parse);
* Optimise general speed of parsing (replace function calls?).
* Figure out if everything I've done is good or bad C :^)
